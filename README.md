# HTML & CSS Layout Projects

This repository contains a collection of layout-based projects developed using HTML5, CSS3, and basic frontend technologies. Most of these projects were created as part of the Udemy course:

**Full Web Development with HTML5, CSS3, JS, AJAX, PHP & MySQL**  
Completed in October 2023

The projects focus mainly on:

- Semantic HTML structure  
- Responsive design with Flexbox and CSS Grid  
- Clean CSS architecture (some using SCSS and Gulp)  
- Basic JavaScript functionality

The project **CasasRuralesElOlivo** was developed during the subject *Web Interface Design* as part of my **Higher Technical Education in Web Application Development (DAW)**.

These projects were key to strengthening my frontend development skills.
